        <div class="question-title"><strong>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></div>
        <p class="f-paragraph-large">Brand Advance LTD., together with its affiliates (“Brand Advance”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to providing transparency and control over the use of the data in online advertising.<br>‍<br>This privacy policy details Brand Advance’ data practices on how we collect, use, process and share the data we may collect through our advertising services (collectively, the “Services”) as well as the ways in which individuals may exercise control over the use of information collected by us.
